Class: Introduction to Data Structures

Date:April 14, 2020

Two part assignment:
1)Continued previous investigation of Democratic primary polling data by using a heap to sort the candidates by their polling numbers (to determine which candidates are currently in the lead).
2)Implemented Huffman coding
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

Heap Overview:

-Implement the PriorityQueue interface as an ArrayHeap with the maximum at the top
-Implement Heap Sort in-place
-Heap Sort of Candidates using removeMax

Huffman Coding Overview:

-Implement Huffman Coding by building a tree that represents the encoding given (recommended to use a linked data structure, not a heap)
